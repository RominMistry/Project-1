        New Delhi, the national capital of India, is a traveler's paradise, to say the least.
        As a city that has seen the rise and fall of many dynasties, Delhi boasts of several monuments and heritage places that pay tribute to its rich cultural and political past. 
        While there is a good range of historical places to visit in Delhi, the city doesn't lack in gardens, museums, places of worship, adventure spots, and theme parks, either.
        Add to that the vibrant shopping destinations, local markets, and street food, Delhi easily tops the list of best tourist places in North India.
